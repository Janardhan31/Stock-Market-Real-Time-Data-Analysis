# Stock-Market-Real-Time-Data-Analysis
In this project, we will execute an End-To-End Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.
This project simulates a real-time stock market data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka, AWS Cloud Services, and Python. It showcases how streaming data from a producer can be ingested, stored, cataloged, and queried using scalable cloud-native technologies.
We are using different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.
